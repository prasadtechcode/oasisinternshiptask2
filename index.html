<h2>A brief summary of Swamiji's journey</h2>
<h3 class="center">Early life</h3>
<p>
    Vivekananda, original name Narendranath Datta, Datta also spelled Dutt, (born January 12, 1863, Calcutta [now Kolkata]—died July 4, 1902, near Calcutta), Hindu spiritual leader and reformer in India who attempted to combine Indian spirituality with Western material progress, maintaining that the two supplemented and complemented one another. His Absolute was a person’s own higher self; to labour for the benefit of humanity was the noblest endeavour. 
</p>

<p>
    Born into an upper-middle-class family of the Kayastha (scribes) caste in Bengal, he was educated at a Western-style university where he was exposed to Western philosophy, Christianity, and science. Social reform became a prominent element of Vivekananda’s thought, and he joined the Brahmo Samaj (Society of Brahma), dedicated to eliminating child marriage and illiteracy and determined to spread education among women and the lower castes. He later became the most-notable disciple of Ramakrishna, who demonstrated the essential unity of all religions. 

</p>
<h3 class="center">Return to India</h3>
<p>
    On his return to India with a small group of Western disciples in 1897, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission at the monastery of Belur Math on the Ganges (Ganga) River near Calcutta (now Kolkata). Self-perfection and service were his ideals, and the order continued to stress them. He adapted and made relevant to the 20th century the very highest ideals of the Vedantic religion, and, although he lived only two years into that century, he left the mark of his personality on East and West alike

<h3 class="center">Legacy</h3>
<p>
    The real roots of Indian nationalism were made known to the world by Swami Vivekananda. He demonstrated how a country with such extreme diversity can nevertheless be united by a sense of brotherhood and humanity. Vivekananda focused on the shortcomings of western civilization and how India helped to overcome them. According to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose: "Swamiji brought together the East and the West, science and religion, the past and the present. 
 
    That's why he's so awesome. His lessons have helped our compatriots develop a level of self-respect, self-reliance, and self-assertion that is unprecedented." Vivekananda was effective in creating a fictitious link between Eastern and Western cultures. He provided Westerners with interpretations of Hindu scriptures, philosophy, and way of life. He helped them understand that, despite its underdevelopment and poverty, India had a significant cultural contribution to contribute. He was instrumental in breaking India's cultural barrier to the rest of the globe.
